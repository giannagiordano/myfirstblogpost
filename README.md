A Subject Self-Defined
‘Nude Descending A Staircase’

I was drawn to ‘A Subject Self-Defined’, created by new media artist Carla Gannis, because it is centered on the subject of women’s agency and addresses this critical idea by exploring selfie culture. I find this body of work unique because it came out of Gannis’s own experience and became a way for her to express herself and find her own voice. Furthermore, even though this project began as a means through which the artist could reflect on her own identity and personal experiences, it grew into a broader work that tells a story that every woman can identify with and understand. ‘A Subject Self-Defined’, speaks to the fact that while women’s bodies have been portrayed through art for years, the introduction of the selfie represents one of the first times that women have been given agency to choose how to photograph and depict their own bodies and the opportunity to share these photographs on the internet. Gannis’s work helped me look at selfie culture in a new light, and I enjoyed how she portrays a theme that affects so many women in a beautiful and interactive way. ‘A Subject Self-Defined’ was displayed in the TRANSFER Gallery in Brooklyn as a solo exhibition of moving images from January 23rd to March 19th, 2016.
